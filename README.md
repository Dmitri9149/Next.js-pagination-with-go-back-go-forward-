The work is based on the [How to add pagination to your Next.js app](https://blog.logrocket.com/add-pagination-next-js-app/)    

I was interested to check how ```go back``` and  ```go forward```   buttons interfere with pagination in Next.js

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev buttons 
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
